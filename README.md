# Open Engineering
This repository contains the source code used to produce the videos published on the [**Open Engineering** YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfEiVXhy9rj4wdqpD_Il6Zg).

The animations are primarily based on the [Community Edition](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) of [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim): an animation engine for explanatory math videos, originally created by Grant Sanderson ([3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/)).

## About the channel

**Open Engineering** was created with the goal of making education around electrical engineering accessible to everyone. These videos are intended for a broad audience, ranging from students and hobbyists, to professionals working in fields like radio frequency engineering, telecommunications, and radio astronomy instrumentation.

This channel is run by Apostolos Spanakis-Misirlis, and the published content will remain _free_.
